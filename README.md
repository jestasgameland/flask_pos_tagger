First app in Flask - a part-of-speech tagger with NLTK

How it works:
- Gets a random sentence from Tatoeba corpus
- Then uses NLTK to tokenize and get parts of speech
- Finally, uses Python Flask to display as HTML 


# How to use:
1. Navigate to folder
2. In terminal (windows):  set FLASK_APP=pos_tagger_app.py
3. flask run
